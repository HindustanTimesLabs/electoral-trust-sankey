      <p>In recent years, electoral trust companies have emerged as a major source of funding for political parties. For the corporations that finance them, electoral trusts give an impression of an arms-length transaction, creating a buffer that allows companies to give money to parties without appearing to favour one over the other.</p>
      <p>Between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2016, donations from seven electoral trusts amounted to more than Rs 428 crore â€” amounting to about one third of all the funding disclosed by political parties in that time.</p>

      <p>* General Electoral Trust&rsquo;s contribution report is not available on the Election Commission of India&rsquo;s website. However, political parties to which it has contributed list its address as the Aditya Birla Centre in Mumbai. That address is shared by the <a href="http://www.adityabirla.com/contact">Aditya Birla Group</a>. In FY 2015-16, General Electoral Trust stopped making donations, and a trust called Samaj Electoral Trust, funded by a raft of companies with addresses linked to the Birla Group, began making contributions.

      <p>Some of the country&rsquo;s largest and most influential corporate conglomerates &mdash; from Bharti and Birla to Tata and Torrent &mdash; bankroll these trusts. Together, they represent a broad swath of corporate India invested in highly regulated sectors where seemingly minor changes in policy can have a disproportionate impact on balance sheets.</p>
